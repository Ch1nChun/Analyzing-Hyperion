# Analyzing Hyperion

This is a backup of gogo1000's great thread, Analyzing Byfron. It was on v3rm, and I wanted to archive it incase someone found it useful, so I did!
You can't find the original thread on the new v3rm, but there are some other backups of this.
> [!NOTE]
> this isn't 100% the original thread because I replaced most of the references to Byfron with Hyperion to make it more correct and fixed some spelling issues.
> Other than those changes, it's 100% spot-on.
